AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their behavior. These machines can learn, reason, solve problems, and make decisions. AI is rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, from self-driving cars to virtual assistants.
